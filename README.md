## Udacity CS262: Programming Languages

My solutions to quizzes and problem sets from Udacity's CS262 programming languages course taught by Wes Weimer of the University of Virginia.

This course is a 400-level (i.e. 4th year undergraduate level) course and it explores programming languages by developing an web browser capable of interpreting (a subset of) HTML and JavaScript.

The syllabus is as follows:

### String Patterns

Finding and specifying classes of strings using regular expressions

### Lexical Analysis

Breaking strings down into important words

### Grammars

Specifying and deconstructing valid sentences

### Parsing

Turning sentences into trees

### Interpreting

Simulating programs

### Building a Web Browser

Interpreting HTML and JavaScript
